== Global configuration

Configure Booster by adding a configuration file to your XP instance.

`XP_HOME/config/com.enonic.app.booster.cfg`

.Example configuration with default values
[source,properties]
----
cacheTtl = 3600
cacheSize = 10000
appsForceInvalidateOnInstall =
excludeQueryParams =
disableCacheStatusHeader = false
cacheMimeTypes = text/html, text/xhtml
overrideHeaders =
----

cacheTtl:: Default time-to-live (TTL) for the cache is seconds. The default value is 3600 seconds (1 hour).
cacheSize:: Total number of items in the cache. The default value is 10000.
appsForceInvalidateOnInstall:: Comma-separated list of applications that should invalidate the cache on their installation. By default, no applications are listed.
excludeQueryParams:: Comma-separated list of query parameters that should be excluded from the cache key. Allows to add extra query parameters to exclude from the cache key without need to change default. By default, no extra query parameters are listed.
excludeQueryParamsPreset:: This comma-separated list contains "preset" of query parameters that will not be affected by changing `excludeQueryParams`. More details about this below:
disableCacheStatusHeader:: If set to `true` `Cache-Status` header is not sent in the response. The default value is `false`.
cacheMimeTypes:: Comma-separated list of MIME types that should be cached. The default value is `text/html, text/xhtml`.
overrideHeaders:: Comma-separated list of instructions that override headers. By default, no instructions are listed. Use with causion.


=== Query Parameters

Booster considers query parameters when generating the cache key. However, some query parameters are not relevant, and should be excluded for a better performing cache. Examples of such are marketing and ads related parameters, where the rendered result will look the same regardlessly.

`excludeQueryParamsPreset` contains a list query parameters that should be excluded from the cache key. These complete list is:

`+fbclid, twclid, dclid, gclid, gclsrc, wbraid, gbraid, msclkid, yclid, _ga, _gl, utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_term, utm_source_platform, utm_creative_format, utm_marketing_tactic, _hsenc, __hssc, __hstc, __hsfp, hsCtaTracking+`

If you want to keep the default list and add extra query parameters to exclude from the cache key, you can use the `excludeQueryParams` configuration property. To override the presets, simply add your own version of `excludeQueryParamsPreset` in the configuration file.


=== MIME Types

Booster caches `text/html` and `text/xhtml` MIME types by default. The `cacheMimeTypes` configuration property is a comma-separated list of MIME types that should be cached.

Allow caching of `text/plain` (such as robots.txt), `text/xml` (such as sitemap.xml) and application/manifest+json (manifest.json) MIME types:
[source,properties]
----
cacheMimeTypes=text/html, text/xhtml, text/plain, text/xml, application/manifest+json
----

NOTE: Booster does not cache responses with `Vary` header, including but not limited to `Vary: Accept`.


=== Control downstream cache

Different CDN and proxy servers can cache the response. Booster can help to control the downstream cache by using `overrideHeaders` configuration property allows to override response headers. The property is a comma-separated list of instructions that override headers. Each instruction is a key-value pair separated by a colon. The key is the header name and the value is the header value. The header value can contain placeholders that are replaced with the actual value from the original response.

Disable caching in the downstream cache (CDN and browser):
[source,properties]
----
overrideHeaders="Cache-Control: private, no-store"
----

Disable cache in Fastly CDN but leave browser caching instruction as is:
[source,properties]
----
overrideHeaders="Surrogate-Control: private"
----

Disable cache in Cloudflare CDN but leave browser caching instruction as is:
[source,properties]
----
overrideHeaders="Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control: private"
----

Allow Fastly CDN to cache the response for 24 hours, but browser should cache the response for 1 minute:
[source,properties]
----
overrideHeaders="Surrogate-Control: max-age=86400","Cache-Control: max-age=60"
----

NOTE: Only the following cache headers may be set:
`Cache-Control`, `CDN-Cache-Control`, `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control`, `Surrogate-Control`, `Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control`,
 `Akamai-Cache-Control`


== Site configuration

When adding Booster to a site, it may be tuned specifically

image::images/site-config.png[Adding Booster to your site, 739]

=== Cache patterns

By default, Booster caches all regular paths within a site. However, there are cases when some paths should not be cached, or only some paths should be cached.

`Patterns` lets you tune caching only for specific paths.

If no patterns are provided, all paths are cached. By adding a pattern, no path are cached by default, and you must ensure at least one pattern matches requests to be cached.

A pattern is a regular expression that is used to match the request path. A pattern element may also contain an `invert` attribute to indicate that the result of evaluating the regular expression should be negated.

The syntax of the pattern is the same as https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/mappings#pattern_mappings[XP Framework pattern mappings].

=== Default TTL

Default TTL setting allows to specify cache TTL for controller responses without max-age or s-max-age headers.
By default, the value is not set and the cache TTL is determined by the `cacheTtl` configuration property.
